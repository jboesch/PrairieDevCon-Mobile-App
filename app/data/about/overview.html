    We're thrilled to announce Prairie IT Pro & Dev Con 2012, happening October 1-3 in Regina, Saskatchewan! This year will be our biggest one yet in Regina and we have a lot happening over the 4 days!
</p>
<h3>Four Days?! And What's This IT Pro Thing About?</h3>
<p>This year conference events will be spread over four days!</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, September 29th - Free All Day Hackathon</strong></p><p>Hackathons are day-long, hands-on coding workshops put on by community members. Over the last year, with the explosion of
    Open Data, these Hackathons have focussed on leveraging open APIs to create some fantastic applications. Prairie Dev Con is proud to sponsor this event and provide it for free to the communitY! We'll
    have more information, including how to register, later this summer.</p>
<p><strong>Monday, October 1 - Tuesday, October 2</strong></p><p>For software developers, this is two days of fantastic sessions presented by world class speakers. We took feedback from our online survey, and
    took the pulse of the provincial tech heartbeat, and have come up with a session lineup like no other! HTML5, JavaScript, and other web development topics are alongside a strong mobile track, agile,
    database/BI, development foundation, and more! And we're not done updating our session list yet! Take a look at our current lineup and keep watching for updates as we finalize the sessions over the summer.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, October 3</strong><br />We've been having a great time putting on a software development conference - so much so that we wanted to invite the IT Pros in Saskatchewan to come out as well! So
    starting this year we're adding a <strong>dedicated IT Pro Day!</strong> This day will cover topics like virtualization, server infrastructure, platform administration, and others. We're waiting for confirmation
    from a number of speakers and will have our IT Pro session lineup posted later in July. We're very excited to offer this to the Saskatchewan IT Pro community!</p>
<p>For those software developers that are looking for a third-day event, fear not! We have Donald Belcham back to do a full day workshop on Aspect Oriented Develpoment! You can find more information on this
    workshop <a href="http://prairiedevcon.com/Workshops">on our Workshop page.</a></p>
<h3>How Does Registration Work?</h3>
<p>We're making it flexible so people can attend as much or as little of the three day content as they like. We have four different registration options:
<ul>
    <li>Software Dev Days Only</li>
    <li>IT Pro Day Only</li>
    <li>All Three Days</li>
    <li>Software Dev Days and Post-Con AOP Workshop</li>
</ul>
And yes, groups of 3+ still get an extra $50 off each registration!
</p>
<h3>STUDENTS!</h3>
<p>We want to encourage students to come out to the conference - not just to learn about what's currently happening in the tech industry, but also to network and socialize with those in the community. So
    to that end we're offering two new programs for students.</p><p>The first is a discounted student rate for the Software Dev days portion of the conference.</p><p>The second is through our sponsorship program. <strong>
    The conference will donate a free pass to U of R, SIAST, and Sask U for each Gold, Platinum, and Diamond sponsorship purchased!</strong> So in addition to helping the conference to operate, sponsors will
    also be helping the next generation of professionals interact with the industry. You can find out more info about our sponsorship package <a href="http://prairiedevcon.com/SponsorInfo">on our Sponsor Info page</a>.</p>
<h3>Register Early to Save!</h3>
<p>We're going to be opening up registration on Friday (June 15th) morning, and we have early bird discounts available for those that register early! Make sure you claim your spot at the conference sooner than later! Looking forward to seeing everyone out at Prairie IT Pro and Dev Con 2012!</p>
